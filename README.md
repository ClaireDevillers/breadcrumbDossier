# MERN breadcrumb and directory 

This is a small example mern stack app to demonstrate my knowledge of Frontend and Backend

  - (1) the backend is nodeJS and allow you to send your current location and the server will tell you the files and folders in this location
  - (2) the frontend is react and will draw a breadcrumb path and you can click on any of the parents to fetch his children
