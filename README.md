# MERN breadcrumb and directory 

This is a small example mern stack app to demonstrate my knowledge of Frontend and Backend

  - (1) the backend is nodeJS and allow you to send your current location and the server will tell you the files and folders in this location
  - (2) the frontend is react and will draw a breadcrumb path and you can click on any of the parents to fetch his children

## How to run code locally

To run the code locally you can to:
1. clone the repository. 
2. Do `npm install` to install all the node module
3. Do `npm run build` to generate the build folder
4. Then do `nodemon server.js` to run the nodeJS server backend.
5. Optionally, do `npm start` to run the React frontend in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
